# Project Plan: Telegram Bot-based Employee Management System

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the comprehensive plan for developing a Telegram bot-based Employee Management System (EMS). The system aims to provide a robust, subscription-based solution for companies to manage their employee data efficiently through a Telegram bot interface, eliminating the need for a traditional web-based front-end. The core functionalities include employee data management, role-based access control, a flexible licensing model, and automated payment processing.

## 2. Project Roles

The system defines three primary roles, each with distinct responsibilities and access levels:

*   **Main Admin (Bot Owner):** This role belongs to the owner of the bot. The Main Admin has overarching control over the entire system, including generating licenses and API keys for companies, monitoring all company subscriptions, and overseeing the overall health and operation of the bot. They are responsible for the system's infrastructure and global settings.

*   **Company Owner (HR/Admin):** This role represents the administrative user within a company. A Company Owner is responsible for purchasing subscriptions (lifetime or time-bound) for their respective company. They have full administrative control over their company's employee data, including adding, editing, viewing, and managing employee records. They can only access and manage data pertinent to their own company, ensuring data segregation and privacy.

*   **Employee:** This role is for individual employees registered under a company. Employees have limited access, primarily restricted to viewing their own personal data. They are explicitly prevented from sending direct messages to any admin (Main Admin or Company Owner) through the bot, maintaining a clear communication hierarchy and preventing unsolicited queries.

## 3. Core Features

The EMS will incorporate the following key features to deliver a complete employee management solution:

*   **Telegram Bot-only Interface:** The entire system will operate exclusively through a Telegram bot, providing a streamlined and accessible user experience without the need for a separate web interface. This simplifies deployment and access for users.

*   **Subscription Management:** Company Owners can select various subscription types, including 1-month, 6-month, or lifetime plans, offering flexibility based on their operational needs. This model ensures recurring revenue and scalable access.

*   **Automated Payment Notifications:** Upon successful payment, an automated message will be sent to the Main Admin's Telegram inbox, providing real-time updates on new subscriptions and revenue.

*   **API Key Generation:** The Main Admin will have the capability to generate unique API keys for companies. These keys will be tied to the subscription type (time-bound or lifetime) and will control access to the bot's functionalities for each company.

*   **Multi-Company Data Segregation:** Each company will operate with its own distinct database ID, ensuring that employee data is securely separated and accessible only by the respective Company Owner. This is crucial for data privacy and compliance.

*   **Comprehensive Employee Data Management:** The system will support full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for employee data. This includes fields such as name, designation, phone number, employee ID, joining date, and salary. Company Owners can edit and view all relevant employee information.

*   **Role-Based Data Access:** Company HR/Admins will only be able to view and manage employees belonging to their specific company, reinforcing data security and preventing cross-company data access.

*   **Main Admin Oversight:** The Main Admin will possess the ability to view all company licenses and subscription statuses, providing a centralized overview of the system's usage and revenue streams.

## 4. Technology Stack

To ensure a robust, scalable, and maintainable system, the following technologies have been selected:

*   **Backend:** Python will be the primary language for the bot's backend logic. We will utilize either `aiogram` or `pyTelegramBotAPI` as the Telegram Bot API wrapper. Both libraries are asynchronous and provide efficient handling of Telegram updates. `aiogram` is generally preferred for its modern async/await syntax and robust features, but `pyTelegramBotAPI` is also a viable option for simpler implementations. The final choice will be made during the development phase based on specific feature requirements and ease of integration.

*   **Database:** MySQL will serve as the relational database for storing all system and employee data. MySQL is a mature, reliable, and widely supported database system, suitable for handling structured data and ensuring data integrity. It offers good performance and scalability for the anticipated data volume.

*   **Deployment:** Render.com will be the chosen platform for hosting the Telegram bot. Render provides a seamless deployment experience for Python applications, including support for persistent databases like MySQL. Its continuous deployment features from GitHub repositories will simplify updates and maintenance.

*   **Code Repository:** GitHub will be used for version control and collaborative development. The repository can be configured as private or public based on project requirements, ensuring secure code management and team collaboration.

*   **Documentation Website:** GitHub Pages will host the documentation website. This platform is ideal for static site hosting, providing a simple and free solution for publishing support guides, pricing information, and installation instructions. Markdown will be used for content creation, which can be easily rendered by GitHub Pages.

## 5. Bot Command Structure

The bot will expose a set of intuitive commands to facilitate user interaction and system management:

*   `/start`: Initiates the bot interaction for new users, primarily Company Owners, allowing them to select a subscription type.

*   `/buy`: Displays the pricing list for various subscription plans and provides direct payment support options.

*   `/employees`: Provides a list of all employees registered under the Company Owner's company.

*   `/add_employee`: Guides the Company Owner through the process of adding a new employee record.

*   `/edit_employee`: Allows Company Owners to modify existing employee data.

*   `/view_employee`: Enables Company Owners to view detailed information for a specific employee.

*   `/support`: Provides a mechanism for Company Owners to send direct messages to the Main Admin's Telegram ID for support queries.

*   `/genkey [duration]`: (Main Admin only) Generates an API key with a specified duration (e.g., `1m` for 1 month, `6m` for 6 months, `lifetime` for lifetime access).

## 6. Licensing and Subscription Model

The licensing model is central to the system's operation and revenue generation:

*   **API Key-based Control:** Access to the bot's functionalities for each company will be controlled by a unique API key generated by the Main Admin.

*   **Subscription Tiers:** Companies can choose between time-bound subscriptions (1 month, 6 months) and a lifetime subscription. Each tier will have a corresponding API key validity period.

*   **Automated Expiration:** The system will automatically track the expiration of time-bound licenses. Upon expiration, the associated company's bot functionalities will cease to work, requiring a renewal or new purchase.

*   **User-driven Purchase:** The system is designed to allow users (Company Owners) to purchase API keys directly through the bot, streamlining the onboarding and renewal process.

## 7. Payment Integration Plan

While the specific payment gateway will be determined during implementation, the plan involves:

*   **Price List Display:** The `/buy` command will present a clear and concise price list for all subscription tiers.

*   **Direct Payment Support:** The system will integrate with a payment gateway to facilitate direct payments within the Telegram environment or via a secure external link. (Placeholder for now, specific gateway to be chosen later).

*   **Admin Notifications:** Post-payment, an automated message will be sent to the Main Admin's Telegram ID, confirming the successful transaction and subscription details.

## 8. Deployment Strategy

The deployment process will leverage GitHub and Render.com for continuous integration and delivery:

1.  **Code Upload to GitHub:** The entire bot codebase will be hosted on a GitHub repository (private or public).

2.  **Render.com Account Setup:** A Render.com account will be required for deployment.

3.  **New Web Service Creation:** On Render.com, a new web service will be created, linked directly to the GitHub repository.

4.  **Runtime Configuration:** The runtime environment will be set to Python.

5.  **Build Command:** The build command will be `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all necessary Python dependencies.

6.  **Start Command:** The start command will be `python bot.py` (or the name of the main bot file).

7.  **Database URL Integration:** The MySQL database URL will be securely added to the Render environment variables, accessible to the bot as an `.env` file or directly as environment variables.

8.  **Automated Deployment:** Render.com's continuous deployment feature will automatically deploy the bot whenever changes are pushed to the linked GitHub repository, ensuring the bot is always live with the latest updates.

## 9. Security and Limitations

*   **Employee Communication Restriction:** Employees will be explicitly prevented from sending messages to any admin (Main Admin or Company Owner) through the bot, ensuring a controlled communication flow.

*   **Company-Specific Admin Control:** Company Admins will only have access to manage data pertinent to their own company, preventing unauthorized access to other companies' information.

*   **Main Admin Full Control:** The Main Admin retains full control and oversight over all aspects of the system, including all company data and licensing.

## 10. Bot Lifetime Model

*   **Lifetime Access:** Companies can opt for a one-time purchase for lifetime access to the bot's features.

*   **Time-based Licensing:** The system supports time-based licenses (e.g., 1 month, 6 months) with automated expiration and renewal requirements.

*   **Self-Service API Key Purchase:** The system is designed to allow Company Owners to purchase and manage their API keys directly through the bot, promoting a self-service model.

## 11. Conclusion

This project plan provides a detailed roadmap for developing a comprehensive and secure Telegram bot-based Employee Management System. By leveraging Python, MySQL, and Render.com, we aim to deliver a robust, scalable, and user-friendly solution that meets the specified requirements for role-based access, subscription management, and efficient employee data handling. The focus on a Telegram-only interface simplifies deployment and enhances accessibility for users.
